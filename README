## Description
A library to make your existing REXML code compatible with other XML libraries
such as Nokogiri.

## Installation
gem install rexml-compat

## Usage

# Remove any references to rexml in your Gemfile, gemspec, etc, including
any explicit 'require' statements.

# Then require the compatibility layer that's right for you.
require 'rexml/compat/nokogiri' # or...
require 'rexml/compat/oga' # or...
require 'rexml/compat/libxml'

That's it. Your XML handling code should now "Just Work". Or, at least, make
your conversion efforts much easier.

## Who should use this?
Some projects use REXML initially because it's pure Ruby, has no external
dependencies, and is part of the standard library. As your project grows you
realize that REXML is both slow and memory hungry.

Consequently, you've decided to switch to another XML library and accept the
external dependencies because REXML is just too slow and/or memory hungry for
you application now. However, you quickly realize that the API for your
XML library of choice is not quite the same as REXML and converting it yourself
be a pain.

If this is the situation you're in, then this is the library for you.

## Future Plans
Initially we will add a compatibility layer for Nokogiri. Compatibility with
other xml gems will be added later.
